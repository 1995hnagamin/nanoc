# nanoc

nanoc is a simple but very flexible static site generator written in Ruby.
It operates on local files, and therefore does not run on the server. nanoc
“compiles” the local source files into HTML (usually), by evaluating eRuby,
Markdown, etc.

## Requirements

Ruby 1.9.x and up.

nanoc has no few dependencies on its own. Sub-projects, such as filters and
helpers, may have dependencies of their own, however.

## Installation

`gem install nanoc` or take a look at the [installation page](http://nanoc.ws/install/).

## Versioning

nanoc uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Documentation
